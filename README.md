## Threats and Security Notifications

The file repository of scripts used for our study _Identifying Brain Correlates of Cybersecurity Notifications_, REB 2019-4945 at Dalhousie University, done through the [NeuroCognitive Imaging Lab](https://ncil.science/). This study was later nicknamed "tsn" for short, standing for "threats and security notifications". We are currently preparing an article to disseminate the results of this study in a way that is accessible to anyone in the world.

In this folder you will find our analysis scripts for the project and a copy of the PsychoPy paradigm used in the experiment. All analysis files consist of Jupyter notebooks that leverage the Python or R programming language. The repository contains scripts for individual analysis of the 24 participants analyzed in the study, as well as scripts used to generate the statistical analysis, grand average images, and bar charts. The paradigm files are Python files that can be executed by PsychoPy 3. The paradigm is missing many image files because these are files that were extracted from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and it would be a breach of our terms of use. The files that we used are mentioned in the script and can be retireved from the IAPS by [contacting them](https://csea.phhp.ufl.edu/media/iapsmessage.html).

The data used in this analysis is publicly avaliable and [can be found here](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP3/RDXI6P). We also have a manuscript submitted to a journal for review, which we may cite in the coming months. If you have any questions about this script, please do not hesitate to reach out to Conrad either through Github or at my institutional email address.
